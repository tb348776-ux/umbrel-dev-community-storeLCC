tagline: DGB node + solo pool
description: >-
  Run a DigiByte full node (DigiByte Core) and a solo Stratum v1 pool (Miningcore) as a single Umbrel app installation.


  Features:
    - Axe-style dashboard for node sync, Stratum status, and pool stats
    - SHA256 + Scrypt Stratum ports in one app install
    - SHA256 difficulty presets (vardiff) for small miners through to high-hashrate rigs
    - Support ticket submission with basic diagnostics


  Miner connection:
    - Set your solo payout address in the app Settings tab.
    - SHA256 Stratum URL: `stratum+tcp://<your-umbrel-ip>:5678`
    - Scrypt Stratum URL: `stratum+tcp://<your-umbrel-ip>:5679`
    - Username: a worker label (recommended: `rig01.workername`). `walletAddress.workername` also works, but it does not control payout.
    - Password: anything


  Notes:
    - Payout address must be a legacy/base58 DigiByte address (starts with `D`/`S`). `dgb1...` payout is not supported yet.
    - First sync and the first boot after some upgrades can be heavy on RAM and disk. 16GB is recommended; 8GB is the practical minimum.
    - Solo mining is extremely unlikely to find blocks without significant hashrate.


  Backend:
    - DigiByte Core (MIT): https://github.com/digibyte-core/digibyte
    - Miningcore (GPLv3): https://github.com/oliverw/miningcore


  Status:
    - BETA build: expect bugs and breaking changes. Verify payout addresses before mining.
